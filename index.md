## About Me

I'm currently a Undergraduate student (from 2023 Fall) in [IIIS (Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), persuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

In the summer of 2024, I joined [THUML](https://github.com/thuml) under the supervision of [Prof. Mingsheng Long](http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~mlong/).

My research goal is to develop **Fundamental models with an intrinsic understanding of the world** and apply this to obtain **general decision intelligence**. Currently, my research interests include:

- **World Models**: State-based World Models, Visual World Models, Grounding Foundation Models(e.g. Video Diffusion Models, LLMs) to World Models.

- **Data-driven reinforcement learning & decision making**: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, Offline Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning.

## News
